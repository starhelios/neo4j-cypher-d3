== Cy2Neo - Tiny Neo4j Cypher Workbench with Alchemy.js Viz

Cy2Neo is a tiny *Neo4j query console*, in a single HTML-page using client-side JavaScript only.

http://neo4j.org[Neo4j] is an open source graph database and http://neo4j.org/learn/cypher[Cypher] is Neo4j's graph query language.

Cypher queries are highlighted with http://codemirror.net/[CodeMirror].

Graph query results are rendered with http://graphalchemist.github.io/Alchemy[Alchemy.js] by http://graphalchemist.com[GraphAlchemist, PDX] for graph rendering.

Cy2Neo uses a simple Neo4j connector that posts Cypher queries to Neo4j's transactional http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-transactional.html[Cypher HTTP endpoint] using jQuery Ajax requests.

You can http://jexp.github.io/cy2neo[try it live here], it should be able to connect to any Neo4j 2.x instance that's accessible from your machine.
Just enter the Neo4j-URL in the box on the right side.

I wrote most of it while flying from OSCON @ Portland,OR to Chicago on my way home to Dresden, Germany.
